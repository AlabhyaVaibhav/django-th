Used to generate the body of the activation email. Should display a
link the user can click to activate the account. This template has the
following context:

``activation_key``
    The activation key for the new account.

``expiration_days``
    The number of days remaining during which the account may be
    activated.

``site``
    An object representing the site on which the user registered;
    depending on whether ``django.contrib.sites`` is installed, this
    may be an instance of either ``django.contrib.sites.models.Site``
    (if the sites application is installed) or
    ``django.contrib.sites.models.RequestSite`` (if not). Consult `the
    documentation for the Django sites framework
    http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/contrib/sites/`_ for
    details regarding these objects' interfaces.

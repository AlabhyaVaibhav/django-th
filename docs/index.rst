Description:
------------
The goal of this project is to be independant from any other solution like 
IFTTT, CloudWork or others.

Thus you could host your own solution and manage your own triggers without 
depending any non-free solution.

With this project you can host triggers for you.

All you need is to have a hosting provider (or simply your own server ;) 
who permits to use a manager of tasks like "cron" and, of course Python

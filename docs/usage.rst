Usage 
======

Activating services : 
---------------------

The user activates the service for their own need. If the service requires an external authentication, he will be redirected to the service which will ask him the authorization to acces the user's account. Once it's done, goes back to django-trigger-happy to finish and record the "auth token".

Using the activated services :
------------------------------

a set of 3 pages will ask to the user information that will permit to trigger data from a service "provider" to a service "consummer".

For example : 

* page 1 : the user gives a RSS feed
* page 2 : the user gives the name of the notebook where notes will be stored and a tag if he wants
* page 3 : the user gives a description


Fire the Triggers :
===================
To start handling the queue of triggers you/your users configure, just set the fire.py in a crontab or any other scheduler solution of your choice.
Keep in mind to avoid to set a too short duration between 2 run to avoid to be blocked by the externals services you/your users want to reach.
